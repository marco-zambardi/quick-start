# Creating a new Do Not Disturb Policy

## Overview  

A DND policy is defined by creating one or more quantity and time-based delivery rules, for example, allow a maximum of one delivery each day and up to five deliveries each week. These rules are then used to filter the contacts belonging to the relevant segment, when a plan is run.

- Click the **Settings** tab in the **navigation bar** on the **Contactplan UI start** page
