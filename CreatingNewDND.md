# Creating a new Do Not Disturb Policy

## Overview  

A DND policy is defined by creating one or more quantity and time-based delivery rules, which are then applied to the contacts belonging to the relevant segment when a plan is run. For example, allow a maximum of one delivery each day and up to five deliveries each week.

## Creating a DND policy  

Do the following:  

- Click the **Settings** tab in the **navigation bar** on the **Contactplan UI start** page
- Click the **DND policy** tab on the **Settings** page  
  The **Do Not Disturb policy** page displays.

To add a second rule, check the "Add rule" button.
To save the policy, click on the "Save" button.

You can set the policy as the default DND policy, i.e. the policy that will be automatically selected in each new Plan, checking the left button "Default".
