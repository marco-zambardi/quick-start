# Creating a new Do Not Disturb Policy

A Do Not Disturb (DND) policy is defined by by creating one or more quantity and time-based delivery rules, which are applied to the contacts in the relevant segment when a plan is run. For example, allow a maximum of one delivery each day and up to five deliveries in a week.

To create a new DND policy, select on the navigation bar "Setting" and then "DND policy". If, no DND policy have been already created, the page will look like this:

You can set the policy as the default DND policy, i.e. the policy that will be automatically selected in each new Plan, checking the left button "Default".
