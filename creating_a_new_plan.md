The result of a scheduled plan is the generation of a Contact List. This List can be either stored in the system for future downloand or send to an sFTP folder or sent to Contactlab delivery platform for email or SMS delivery. When you create a new Plan, in the "Consumer" tab, you can choose how to use the Contact List generated by the Plan.

When you select "SFTP Consumer", the system will save the Contacts List generated by the segment (and by the DND policy) into a SFTP server. The sFTP server has been previously configured by Contactlab Operator.

When you select "Clab Consumer", the system will display additional fields where you can insert all the required information to create a delivery within Contactlab delivery platform.
